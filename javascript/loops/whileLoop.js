// The while loop executes as long as the condition is true. It can be thought of as a repeating if statement. 

// Syntax

// while (condition) {
//     // Code to execute
// }

let i = 1;
while (i <= 5){
    // execute code 
    console.log("Hey there I am a while loop");
    // increment/decrement
    i++;
};
