// Loops in JavaScript are used to reduce repetitive tasks by repeatedly executing a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. This makes code more concise and efficient.

// Suppose we want to print 'Hello World' five times. Instead of manually writing the print statement repeatedly, we can use a loop to automate the task and execute it based on the given condition.


// The for loop repeats a block of code a specific number of times. 
// It contains initialization, condition, and increment/decrement in one line.
// for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
    // Code to execute
// }

// for loop that prints "hello world" 10 times
for(let i = 2; i < 5; i++){
    // execute code
    console.log("Hello world!!");
};

// example 2
for(let i = 1; i <= 3; i++){
    console.log("Count : ", i);
};
console.log("-------------------------------");
for(let i = 1; i < 3; i++){
    console.log("Count : ", i);
};
