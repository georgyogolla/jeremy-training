// An object in JavaScript is a data structure used to store related data collections. It stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is a unique identifier for the associated value. Objects are dynamic, which means the properties can be added, modified, or deleted at runtime.

// 1. Creation Using Object Literal
// The object literal syntax allows you to define and initialize an object with curly braces {}, setting properties as key-value pairs.
